## About Me

I'm a Master's student in Business Analytics at Seattle University, graduating this August. I first became interested in analytics while studying applied economics at the University of Minnesota, and knew I wanted to pursue graduate education to improve my analytical skills. Seattle University's program turned out to be just what I was looking for! 

Some of my key skills include data visualization and statistical analysis using tools like R, Python, SQL, and PowerBI. Some of my interests for analytics include using data to understand energy, environmental, and urban issues like housing and transportation, though I'm interested in any analytics career opportunity that can allow me to learn and continue to develop my skill set.

Please feel free to check out this website and my [Github page](https://github.com/josephcarl) to see some of the projects I'm working on. I am looking for data analytics opportunities in the Seattle area, so if you know of any, please feel free to email me or contact me via LinkedIn.
